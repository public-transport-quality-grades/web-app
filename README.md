# OeVGK18 Web App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/public-transport-quality-grades/web-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/public-transport-quality-grades/web-app)

This is the web application for OeVGK18, a method for grading public transport services.

This small React application is used to visualize public transport quality gradings created with the [OevGK18 Generator](https://github.com/public-transport-quality-grades/oevgk18-generator).
It works in tandem with the [OeVGK18 backend](https://github.com/public-transport-quality-grades/backend).

Head over to the [Docker README](https://github.com/public-transport-quality-grades/web-app/tree/master/docker) for a complete setup to run this application yourself.
